**Vault**

Vault does not integrate with Cloudron's users (yet). The vault is sealed and you will need the unlock keys.
The keys are stored in the /app/data folder called _vault_init.txt_. You will need to download these
and distribute them. The vault can only be initalised once.

You can access the webgui {appurl/ui} you will need 3 of your unseal keys and the Inital Root Token.
